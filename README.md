# Zelda Cucco Game

This is my first Ironhack project, a game based around my favourite game series, Zelda. I have created a type of *catcher game* using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The character, Link, needs to collect "Rupees" to win the game. But beware, don't hurt those pesky Cuccos. They're more coniving than you think!
